# Operators

## Arithmetic
* % is modulus or remainder operator.
* ++ and -- and increment and decrement.
* standalone, there is no diff b/w prefix and postfix.
* in larger expression, prefix is result of value of operand before operation.  postfix is result of value of operand after operation.

## Relational and Logical operators
* short circuit logical operators: && and ||.
* normal operators will always eval each operand.
* short circuit ones will only eval the 2nd when necessary.
* | is logical or if the operands are bools. | is bitwise or if the operands are hex or ints.

## Bitwise
* You can use bitwise & to determine if a number is odd.
* it basically just performs the bool operations on each bit of the number.


## Shift operators
* left shift shifts everything left and brings 0 to right most
* right shift moves everything right and brings 0 to leftmost position
** respects sign value though.
* shift is one way to mult or div by 2.

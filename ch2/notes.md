Encapsulation
* binds together code and data
* in C# basic unit is class
* C# uses class spec to construct objects

Polymorphism
* allows one interface to addess a general class of actions.
* one interface, multiple methods
* reduces complex by allowing same interface to spec general class of action
* it's the compiler's job to select spec action.

Inheritance
* process where one obj aquire prop of another.
* heirarchy -- objs at bottom on need to define what makes them unique.

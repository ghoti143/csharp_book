# Ch. 1 -- Creation of C#

## CLR -- common language runtime.
* enables portable programs
* mixed-language programming
* secure execution.

## MSIL -- MS Intermediate Language.
* portable instructions indep of specific CPU
* in essence: portable assembly language
* similar to bytecode

## JIT -- Just in Time.
* when .NET prog is exec, CLR activates JIT compiler.
* JIT compiler converts MSIL to native code on demand as needed.
* C# prog executes as native even though it is init comp in MSIL
